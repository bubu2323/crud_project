# Login and CRUD project
=======================================

developed from scratch by Carolina Tronci

* * *

This is my first elaborated project in PHP and it's a crud with a login form to access.
The application allows you to show the list of users, create a new one, modify and delete it.
To access these features it is necessary to be registered and to login. It is possible to register yourself on the appropriate page.

### List of features

*   Login
*   Registration
*   Create
*   Read
*   Update
*   Delete

### What I learned

I have learned to develop this application by putting into practice the theory learned in the last few weeks.
The biggest difficulties were in the editing part, for example in the blindvalues part, but this allowed me to better understand how to manipulate the data received from a user through a form and how to avoid external attacks.
After implementing the first part of the CRUD, I decided to add the login functionality and it was a bit tricky but I enjoyed it. I learned the basics of cryptography and in particular how to send encrypted data to the database and retrieve it to verify correspondence.
For the graphic part I decided to use bootstrap and for the forms I started from an existing template found on the web and I modified it for my needs.
The project was very interesting and I will continue to work on it to improve it further.
